- `Work Start` --> tells program when is particular working day starts
    - must be 0 minutes duration 
    - Event Subject is defined in [`Settings.json`](https://github.com/JanVasko1/KM-Calendar_Reading/blob/main/Libs/Settings.json):
 (`Event_Handler / Events / Start_End_Events / Start`)

- `Work End` --> tells program when is particular working day ends
    - must be 0 minutes duration

- `API_Exchange_server` --> download events directly from Exchange Server for defined User

> [!CAUTION]

# Events Handlers
Here are steps which process the downloaded date into the shape suitable for TimeSheets

### <span style="color:blue;">Overnights</span>
- This handler splits Events if they go over midnight
- This doesn´t require any setup as it is programmed.
- Videly used for multiday Vacation, travel-time ...

> [!TIP]
> ![Overnight Events](https://github.com/JanVasko1/KM-Calendar_Reading/blob/main/images/OverNight.png?raw=true
 "Overnight Events")

### <span style="color:blue;">Fill Empty: General</span>
- This is for filling empty space in the calendar between events where it react on `coverave` palced by each record (sum must be equal to 100%)
- Works only between “Work - Start” and “Work - End” events (only at the time when I'm at work)
- It select one from the list from [`Settings.json`](https://github.com/JanVasko1/KM-Calendar_Reading/blob/main/Libs/Settings.json):
 (`Event_Handler / Events / Empty / General / ...`) and use then coverage [%] to simulate real usage

> [!TIP]
> ![Fill Empty General](https://github.com/JanVasko1/KM-Calendar_Reading/blob/main/images/Empty_General.png?raw=true
 "Fill Empty General")

> [!TIP]

 "Empty General setup")

> [!CAUTION]
> Coverage split --> Under Developemnt

### <span style="color:blue;">Fill Empty: Scheduled</span>
- This agenda is used for regular record planning like if I have Administration and Emails done after lunch at 11:30 – 12:00 of the week day
- Agenda can have multiple setup (only one used on picture)
- If in the period is another Event then this scheduled is not filled

> [!TIP]
> ![Empty Schedules setup](https://github.com/JanVasko1/KM-Calendar_Reading/blob/main/images/Empty_Schedules_setup.png?raw=true
 "Empty Schedules setup")

### <span style="color:blue;">Location</span>
- Currently set for all events `Office`

### <span style="color:blue;">Lunch</span>
- lunch is special event which should be skipped from Timesheet
- Also is used to split  parallel meeting which is planned over the lunch (like whole day meetings)
- Search text can be modified in [`Settings.json`](https://github.com/JanVasko1/KM-Calendar_Reading/blob/main/Libs/Settings.json):
 (`Event_Handler / Events / Special_Events / Lunch / ...`) 

> [!TIP]
> ![Lunch Event](https://github.com/JanVasko1/KM-Calendar_Reading/blob/main/images/Lunch.png?raw=true
 "!unch")

### <span style="color:blue;">Skip Events</span>
- This is the list of evens which should be skiped from registering them into TimeSheets
- Can be extended in [`Settings.json`](https://github.com/JanVasko1/KM-Calendar_Reading/blob/main/Libs/Settings.json):
 (`Event_Handler / Events / Skip / ...`) 

- Text from `Settings.json` is compared with Event subject and if a part of subject contain text from (`Event_Handler / Events / Skip / ...`) then is recognized and event is not considerate for Time Sheets

### <span style="color:blue;">Parralel Events</span>
- This handler helps to process Events which might be in parallelly set in Calendar
- has 2 modes only one can be selected in [`Settings.json`](https://github.com/JanVasko1/KM-Calendar_Reading/blob/main/Libs/Settings.json):
 (`Event_Handler / Events / Parralel_Events / Divide_Method`):
    - `Divide` --> will divide Parralle Events based on logic
    - `Keep_Parralel` --> will keep both parallel events for TimeSheet
    
> [!TIP]
> Divide:
> ![Parralel 1](https://github.com/JanVasko1/KM-Calendar_Reading/blob/main/images/Parralel1.png?raw=true
 "Divide")

> [!TIP]
> Use Shorter:
> ![Parralel 2](https://github.com/JanVasko1/KM-Calendar_Reading/blob/main/images/Parralel2.png?raw=true
 "Divide and use shorter")

> [!TIP]
> Keep parralel:
> ![Parralel Keep](https://github.com/JanVasko1/KM-Calendar_Reading/blob/main/images/Parralel_keep.png?raw=true
 "Parralel Keep")

- has 2 methods for Events start at the same time:
    - `Use_Shorter` --> will consider the shortest event as first pick

 (`Auto_Filler / Details / ...`)
- If there is empty text --> then is not used
- As [`Skip Events`](https://github.com/JanVasko1/KM-Calendar_Reading?tab=readme-ov-file#skip-events) program is based on searching text in the Event Subject to apply mapping

### <span style="color:blue;">Vacation</span>
- Handler of Vacation to register correctly 
    - `All Day` --> takes hours from [`Settings.json`](https://github.com/JanVasko1/KM-Calendar_Reading/blob/main/Libs/Settings.json):
  and apply them into TimeSheet
    - `Half Day` --> uses only the time defined by Event
- If the text appeared (defined by OKBase) in the event Subject [`Settings.json`](https://github.com/JanVasko1/KM-Calendar_Reading/blob/main/Libs/Settings.json):
 (`Event_Handler / Events / Special_Events / Vacation / ...`)
